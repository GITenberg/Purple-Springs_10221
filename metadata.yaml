description: McClung skilfully weaves together a series of social critiques in a tale
  of love, vocation, and coming-of-age, which sees Pearl, as a prototypical McClung,
  take on the corrupt Conservative government of Manitoba - and win. Purple Springs
  explores an important piece of Canadian social history. It invites its readers to
  enter imaginatively an earlier age when women were second-class citizens in law
  as well as custom, and gives at least one woman's view of what needed to be done
  to right that injustice. -Amazon.com.
